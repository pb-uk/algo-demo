# Markdown file

Let's see if **markdown** parsing works here.
Now let's try a component:
<g-link to="/">Home</g-link>

Now for some code.

<app-code-bin>
function eulerStep(state) {
  state.t = state.t + 0.01;
}
</app-code-bin>

This is a g-link:
<g-link to="/docs/more/">More docs</g-link>
and this is a markdown link
[More docs](/docs/more/).
